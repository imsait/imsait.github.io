title: "Assessment of accuracy in calculations of network motif concentration by Rand ESU algorithm"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-IOP-2
excerpt: 'The article deals with the problem of calculating the frequency of network motifs with a help of Rand-ESU algorithm. We have established that while using a Rand-ESU algorithm, it is necessary to cut off (to thin out) the network motifs only on the last level of ESU-tree (and therefore, an implementation of the algorithm requires the construction of almost entire ESU-tree). Examples of calculations are given, they demonstrate, that other strategies to cut-off sampling lead to larger distance errors in calculation.'
